Before using the mod, you have to compile it using Sanny Builder.

Installation:
-------------
Just copy the "Weapon Skill Changer 2.0", and put it into your Modloader folder
or just copy the files inside the "CLEO" folder and paste them in your cleo folder

Commands:
---------
The mod works very simple, just aim with the weapon you want to change its skill, and press on your keyboard "1" for 0 Skill or NO Skill, "2" for Gangster Skill and "3" for Hitman Skill, you can always change those keys for other ones, in the "Weapon Skill Changer.ini", and you can set in "Key1", "Key2" and "Key3" the numbers of the keys you want to use to change the skill of your weapons.

Aditionally, you can set in the ini, the amount of skill you want between 0 and 999.0 for gangster skill of every weapon, every time you press the "Key2", look under the "[WeapSkill]" Section and you'll see, this is very useful if you just created a new weapon.dat, and you change the required skill level for Gangster Level on some weapons, and you want to use the weapon skill changer along with your new weapon.dat, i only made the "Gangster" level skill, available to be configurable through the ini, because, there is only 3 kinds of level skill in San Andreas Weapons: 

1 = no skill, 2 = Gangster, and 3 = Hitman skill, so if 1 and 3 are made specifically for: (1)NO SKILL, AND, (3)HITMAN SKILL, that doesn't make sense to make that available to set any other level, any other particular level apart from those, should be only the GANGSTER Skill Level.

ENJOY!
